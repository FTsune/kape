    "description": "Abiotic disorders are caused by non-living environmental factors such as drought, temperature extremes, pollution, or nutrient deficiencies. These disorders often mimic the appearance of biotic diseases but are not caused by pathogens. Identifying abiotic stress is essential for effective crop management and long-term plant health."

        "Removing plants that are weak, old or already affected by other diseases or pests.",
